# Big Data QA Specialist Challenge

The goal of the challenge is to show the level of technical skills of the 
candidate and his/her ability to work with Big Data. 
The challenge is composed of 3 levels or 3 subtasks. We will evaluate each subtask and rate the level of the candidate. Each subtask has focus on specific skills:

1. Technical skills
2. Data understanding
3. Analytical skills

We have provided a data set (you can download it from [here](https://tda-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/hire-challenge/challenge-qa.jsonl.gz))
 as a gzipped JSONL file. It is up to the candidate to look into the file and analyze data. The data consists of JSON data that are streamed into the file.  The following requirements are all based on the provided data set. 


## Requirements:
- write a report: what did you do? what were the reasons you did it like that?
- demo your solution

`Note`: that all tasks can be completed on regular hardware configuration (e.g. 4GB of RAM) if you are smart and know how to deal with large files.

## sample data
data are corrupted. you have to find what is corrupted and where.
you have to fix it.

### technical skills
1. tell us which records were corrupted and how you have fixed it
2. load data in the tool of your choice (note: that you have to fix corrupted data before you load it)
3. tell us how many records data set contains

### data understanding
4. explain us records structure
5. what do you think those data represents 
6. tell us for which date/time range is provided set

### analytical skills
7. which KPIs you can find and provide us numbers
8. show us some diagram 
9. can you identify some data anomalies in the provided data set

## Evaluation Criteria & Expectations

- ability to load and fix data
- ability to understand date and break down *business* requirements
- ability to demonstrate data manipulation skills
- clean project setup and documentation
- research and use of suitable data structure for a specific use case. explain which and why.
- understanding how to benchmark and analyze performance bottlenecks. what tools did you use?


## Hints:

- expected time is ~8 hours. if you are above that think about which parts to leave out and just document HOW you would do them. 
- tap into other peoples know-how and code.
- if you found the cheatcode for first two levels (well done!) you should try to achieve and third level ;)
- be smart and impress us. it does not matter if you impress us with nice clean solution or with a very clever hack to achieve the business goal in a short time.
